# Infinity-Engine
3D Game Engine 
Infinity-Engine is a 3D game engine developed using Java, OpenGL, and OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL). It includes various features such as textures, normals, a 3D renderer engine, environment map technique, ambient lighting, VAOs, VBOs, EBOs, and an object loader engine for loading 3D objects.

Features:

Textures: The engine supports texture mapping for models.
Normals: The engine calculates and uses surface normals for lighting calculations.
3D Renderer Engine: The engine has a 3D renderer that can render 3D models.

Environment Map Technique:
Cube Map: The engine uses a cube map for environment mapping.
Reflection: The engine uses reflection for environment mapping.
Skybox: The engine uses a skybox for environment mapping.
Ambient Lighting: The engine supports ambient lighting for models.

VAOs: Vertex Array Objects are used to store and organize vertex data for rendering.
VBOs: Vertex Buffer Objects are used to store vertex data in GPU memory for faster rendering performance.
EBOs: Element Buffer Objects are used to store index data for indexed rendering.
Object Loader Engine: The engine includes an object loader that can load 3D objects for rendering.
