# Infinity-Engine
:sunglasses: 3D Game Engine,
Infinity-Engine is a 3D game engine developed using Java, OpenGL, and OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL). It includes various features such as textures, normals, a 3D renderer engine, environment map technique, ambient lighting, VAOs, VBOs, EBOs, and an object loader engine for loading 3D objects.

Features:

1. Textures: The engine supports texture mapping for models.
1. Normals: The engine calculates and uses surface normals for lighting calculations.
1. 3D Renderer Engine: The engine has a 3D renderer that can render 3D models.

1. Environment Map Technique:
    - Cube Map: The engine uses a cube map for environment mapping.
    - Reflection: The engine uses reflection for environment mapping.
    - Skybox: The engine uses a skybox for environment mapping.
    - Ambient Lighting: The engine supports ambient lighting for models.

1. VAOs: Vertex Array Objects are used to store and organize vertex data for rendering.
1. VBOs: Vertex Buffer Objects are used to store vertex data in GPU memory for faster rendering performance.
1. EBOs: Element Buffer Objects are used to store index data for indexed rendering.
1. Object Loader Engine: The engine includes an object loader that can load 3D objects for rendering.
